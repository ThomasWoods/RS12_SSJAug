Another hot blistering day, good thing you have an air conditioned house! Just make sure to keep the windows shut or you'll let out all the cold. Easy enough right?

W,A,S,D to move, mouse to look, left mouse button to open/close windows and doors, hold left shift to run. Gamepad also supported!

Made in the span of 2 weeks for the PIGSquad August "Horror" summer slow jam, creative theme of "Don't let it out."
